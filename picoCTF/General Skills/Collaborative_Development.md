# picoCTF - Collaborative Development

## Description
My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they'll work together?
[Challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/177/challenge.zip)


## Steps
1. Downloaded zip into my personal CTF folder using wget.
2. Unzipped zip folder with unzip command.
3. Found .git folder... git branch -a to identify git branches
4. Moved to first git branch with "git checkout", Found "picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_" in this python version.
5. Moved to second git branch, found "m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_"
6. Moved to third git branch, found "w0rk_7ae8dd33}"

</details> 

## Tools Used
- git branch -a
- git checkout

## Key Takeaway
Learned how to find branches in a .git folder and switch to them to see other versions.
